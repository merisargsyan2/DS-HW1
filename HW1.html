		Life is a struggle for single father Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Evicted from their apartment, he and his young son (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) find themselves alone with no place to go. Even though Chris eventually lands a job as an intern at a prestigious brokerage firm, the position pays no money. The pair must live in shelters and endure many hardships, but Chris refuses to give in to despair as he struggles to create a better life for himself and his son.

<h2  class="hst"><i>Development</i></h2>

<p class="pstyle">
		Chris Gardner realized his story had Hollywood potential after an overwhelming national response to an interview he did with 20/20 in January 2002.[3] He published his autobiography on May 23, 2006, and later became an associate producer for the film. The movie took some liberties with Gardner's true life story. Certain details and events that actually took place over the span of several years were compressed into a relatively short time and although eight-year-old Jaden portrayed Chris as a five-year-old, Gardner's son was just a toddler at the time. Towards the end Chris Gardner has a brief uncredited cameo appearance before the credits.

	<ol>
		<li>"Hey. Don't ever let somebody tell you... You can't do something. Not even me. All right? You got a dream... You gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want something, go get it. Period."</li>
		<li>"Still a dreamer, yet more of a realist than ever before, I knew this was my time to sail. On the horizon I saw the shining future, as before. The difference now was that I felt the wind at my back. I was ready."</li>
		<li>"The world is your oyster. It's up to you to find the pearls."</li>
		<li>"Walk that walk and go forward all the time. Don't just talk that talk, walk it and go forward. Also, the walk didn't have to be long strides; baby steps counted too. Go forward."</li>
		<li>"Wealth can also be that attitude of gratitude with which we remind ourselves everyday to count our blessings." </li>
		<li>"Probably means there's a good chance. Possibly means we might or we might not."</li>
		<li>"Maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what." </li>
		<li>"I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become." </li>
